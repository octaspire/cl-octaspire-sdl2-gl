* Octaspire's Common Lisp FFI for ~SDL2~ and ~OpenGL~ Libraries

** About

This is a hand built foreign function interface (FFI) library
for the ~SDL2~ and ~OpenGL~ libraries, to be used with
Common Lisp.

** Installation

Clone into directory known to [[https://www.quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]]:

#+begin_src shell
cd $HOME/quicklisp/local-projects
git clone https://github.com/octaspire/cl-octaspire-sdl2-gl.git
#+end_src

If necessary, you can register the local projects
using:

#+begin_src lisp
(ql:register-local-projects)
#+end_src

** Usage
*** Small Usage Example

Start a Common Lisp REPL, for example ~sbcl~, ~ccl64~, or ~ecl~
and enter the following program:

#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :cl-octaspire-sdl2-gl)
(in-package :cl-octaspire-sdl2-gl)

(trivial-main-thread:with-body-in-main-thread (:blocking t)
  (with-init (+SDL-INIT-VIDEO+)
    (with-window ("Test" 0 0 256 128 0)
      (with-foreign-objects ((event '(:union sdl-event)))
        (let ((run t))
          (loop while run
                do (loop while (/= (sdl-pollevent event) 0)
                         do (cffi:with-foreign-slots ((type) event (:union sdl-event))
                              (when (eq type :SDL-QUIT) (setf run nil))))))))))
#+end_src

*** Unit Testing

Start a Common Lisp REPL, for example ~sbcl~, ~ccl64~, or ~ecl~ and enter
the following program:

#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :cl-octaspire-sdl2-gl/tests)
(asdf:test-system :cl-octaspire-sdl2-gl)
#+end_src

Or give the following command on the terminal:

#+begin_src shell
make test
#+end_src

Also, if the =tests/main.lisp= buffer is open on GNU Emacs,
you can run the tests with ~M-x recompile~.
